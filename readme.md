Project Description
-------------------
Our client, **Prime Digital Academy: Room 2**, has asked for an app to simulate the behavior of their shelf. That is, a list of items placed on the classroom shelf.

Any visitor to the page can view the shelf, but only logged in users should be able to place objects on the shelf.

Items placed on the shelf should have the following data:

* description

* image url (optional)

* styling

Pro Mode
